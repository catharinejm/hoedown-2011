# Skill
* Being a kid
** When you start out, you can't do anything
** You have to learn how to do *everything* you want to do

* Coming of age
** Passing through adolescence begins the life-long process of self definition
** We have a good groundwork laid for basic life functions
** Now we begin to filter out the things we don't want to do and focus on what's left

* Adulthood
** Having set ourselves on a given course, we intensify our filtering and focus our efforts ever more specifically
** Our strengths and weaknesses become internalized and we identify with them
** This is a large part of "self"
** "Until the age of 25 every man believes that under the right conditions he could be the baddest motherfucker on the planet."

"Cycles within cycles, man..."
