# The Root of our Problem

* Think about something you're good at
** Balancing rocks
** whistling and humming at the same time
** playing an instrument
** shooting freethrows
** rhyming hexameter
** standing on your head
** salsa dancing
** cabinetmaking
** drawing unicorns
** Anything

* Think about when you were bad at it
** Do you remember improving?
** Did the points at which your skill had markedly increased surprise you?
** Did you sometimes not even realize that you had improved?
*** I was sure I wasn't improving at playing the guitar because I had been trying to learn a song for years without improving.
**** Steve Howe's "Mood For a Day"
*** I hadn't listened to it for a very long time though
*** And when I did I realized that I was attempting to play it nearly twice the speed it was written at!
*** I had believed the whole time that the song was above my skill level
*** So I played it faster to match that expectation

** Common sense tells us that things we started working at when we were younger we will be better at
** Why is that?
*** As we get older our bodies and minds yield to entropy and don't work as well?
**** Probably a factor
*** As we move onward in life we run out of time to practice?
**** Probably also a factor
*** Perhaps as we continue improving some things and neglecting others our minds solidify
**** It becomes harder to act outside of our framework
**** We unconsciously direct ourselves away from learning new things
**** Perhaps this is true too.
*** Those are things we can't really control.
**** Some of them to an extent, but generally not

* So it's hopeless, right? Just stick to what you know.

* But what can we control?
** Our preconceptions.
** When you're a kid you're bad at everything!
** The barrier of entry to learning anything is about equal

* So it's hopeless, right? Just stick to what you know.

* Our problem is twofold
** We believe we are incapable
*** For so long we have seen ourselves as "not good" at something that we aren't able to think differently
*** Perhaps we believe those things are less worthy of effort
**** Justification of our lack of skill
**** It fits the narrative of our lives thus far
** We overestimate our ability to perform new tasks
*** We know we are good at certain things
*** It is easy to falsely believe that we should be better than we are at things we haven't practiced
**** Socrates spent a lifetime demonstrating this
**** (Find dialogue with cobbler example)
*** When we try something new and don't meet our false expectation it reinforces the first problem



# Getting Started

* We all have aspirations
** Too often are "just daydreams"
** or "if-onlys"

* If only what?
** Quit making excuses!
** You _do_ have time!
** Any time time, no matter how little, is better than no time
** Those people who say "Well, no. There's a cutoff. If you don't spend enough time on it you really get no benefit" are wrong!
*** Yeah, OK, maybe you won't get very good.
*** But wouldn't you rather spend your life enjoying the little time you can spend on it?
*** Than spend your life doing _nothing_ while wishing "had time"??
*** TIME IS ALL YOU HAVE. Period! The end! Finito!

* How can I pick one?
** I want to do them all!
** But you can't
** So it doesn't matter!
*** "But some things are qualitatively more important than others! I don't want to waste time on the wrong ones!"
*** By whose standard?
*** Real judgment is only retrospective!
*** Don't be a critic
** Picking any of them is better than picking none of them

* But don't get carried away!
** It's easy to sneak many, if not all, of your aspirations into your "selection"
** Keep the scope small
** Do one thing at a time
** Otherwise the task becomes impossible again!

* Have no expectations
** If you work solely towards an end, you can only be frustrated
** Work for the work itself.
** If you simply act, the results will surprise you.
** Do not underestimate the incredible amount of time spent on creating great works
*** Even if the "work" itself was completed in a short time
*** It is really the culmination of much, much more work you never saw
**** It is akin to claiming Beethoven's 9th only takes about an hour to play
**** While true, it completely misses the point
**** And it took Beethoven the entirety of his life, up until that point, to compose it
**** Putting pen to paper is the shortest and simplest part of the creative process

* Build on existing works
** Don't reinvent the wheel
** You can easily get distracted by trying to learn new things along the way
** Stay on target!
*** Steal the solutions to tangential problems.
*** You can come back to them later.
*** Or maybe you won't! But you'll know why you don't need to then.
** "Standing on the shoulders of giants"
*** This is VERY important.
**** Tan(The mind relates and combines concepts. It only accidentally produces something "original."
****     Take in everyting. And throw away most of it. This is a multiple-pass, life-long process.)

* There are no Superheroes! Forget about them.
** They make excellent stories
** But the characters in those stories are not real individuals
** They are anthropomorphized ideals
*** Think of all the quotes falsely attributed to Mark Twain
*** "Mark Twain" is a name we tie to a set of characteristics
**** Cleverness, wit, satire, honesty, truth, virtue, vice
**** People are angered when their heroes are "slandered"
**** not because the allegations are untrue (though they may be)
**** but because it is an attack on the ideas tied to the legend of the man
**** Sometimes these ideas are so fundamental to a person's worldview that their reactions are visceral
***** The conflation of the individual with the ideals is so old and so strong that to deny one is to deny the other in the minds of some.
***** Jesus or Mohammed, for instance

# Keeping Focused

* It is true that we cannot be good at everything
** We should not attempt to be
** Specialization is important!
*** Have outside interests/hobbies
*** This knowledge can be tied back into what we're really focused on
*** It will give a better breadth of understanding
*** It will keep things interesting
*** But don't try to be an expert in all fields

* Follow your ideas to completion
** But remember not to focus on false ends
*** Work single-mindedly on your task, at all times being mindful of what you are doing now
** A work cannot be judged except in retrospect
*** A mode of thought cannot be judged until many works have been done within it
** And accurate judgment cannot be levied until the fundamentals have been exhausted

* Do not own your work!
** You are putting your "self" on the line when you identify with what you produce
** The work is tangible. Put it above yourself.
*** You will emerge from the process unharmed and bettered for it
*** Besides, it's a bit disingenuous. Credit is due to you and everyone else.
**** The giants' shoulders on which you stand
**** And the shoulders on which those around you are standng
**** Every experience you've ever had is tied to nearly every experience had throughout history
**** When the creative process happens it is through you, not by you.

# Case Study

* Boozers + pathfinders (+ talk?)

# Takeaways

* Practice just above your skill level
** But don't neglect your foundation!
* Perform at it


# Notes from Alan (8/9/2011)

* Tie talk to demo better
* Start with Superhero perspective
** relate that to method
** conclude the talk with the "coincidence" argument. (External circumstances more than internal made some people famous)
* Refine the message.
** 5 or 6 big messages, each of which may be talk worthy.
* Weave the demo into the talk to show how it represents each of my Big Ideas
** Use my method to show it shaped the progress of the game
** May have to fudge reality, but it needn't be disingenuous.

" These are methods that successful people use, but success is not something you should measure objectively. "
