# The Root of our Problem

* Think about something you're good at
** Balancing rocks
** whistling and humming at the same time
** playing an instrument
** shooting freethrows
** rhyming hexameter
** standing on your head
** salsa dancing
** cabinetmaking
** drawing unicorns
** Anything

* Think about when you were bad at it
** Common sense tells us that things we started working at when we were younger we will be better at
** Why is that?
*** As we get older our bodies and minds yield to entropy and don't work as well?
**** Probably a factor
*** As we move onward in life we run out of time to practice?
**** Probably also a factor
*** Perhaps as we continue improving some things and neglecting others our minds solidify
**** It becomes harder to act outside of our framework
**** We unconsciously direct ourselves away from learning new things
**** Perhaps this is true too.
*** Those are things we can't really control.
**** Some of them to an extent, but generally not

* So it's hopeless, right? Just stick to what you know.

* But what can we control?
** Our preconceptions.

* Our problem is twofold
** We believe we are incapable
** We overestimate our ability to perform new tasks



# Getting Started

* We all have aspirations
** Too often are "just daydreams"
** or "if-onlys"

* If only what?
** Quit making excuses!
** You _do_ have time!
** Any time time, no matter how little, is better than no time
** Those people who say "Well, no. There's a cutoff. If you don't spend enough time on it you really get no benefit" are wrong!
*** Yeah, OK, maybe you won't get very good.
*** But wouldn't you rather spend your life enjoying the little time you can spend on it?
*** Than spend your life doing _nothing_ while wishing "had time"??
*** TIME IS ALL YOU HAVE. Period! The end! Finito!

* How can I pick one?
** I want to do them all!
** But you can't
** So it doesn't matter!
** Picking any of them is better than picking none of them

* But don't get carried away!
** It's easy to sneak many, if not all, of your aspirations into your "selection"
** Keep the scope small
** Do one thing at a time
** Otherwise the task becomes impossible again!

* Have no expectations
** If you work solely towards an end, you can only be frustrated
** Work for the work itself.
** If you simply act, the results will surprise you.
** Do not underestimate the incredible amount of time spent on creating great works
*** Even if the "work" itself was completed in a short time
*** It is really the culmination of much, much more work you never saw

* Build on existing works
** Don't reinvent the wheel
** You can easily get distracted by trying to learn new things along the way
** Stay on target!
*** Steal the solutions to tangential problems.
*** You can come back to them later.
*** Or maybe you won't! But you'll know why you don't need to then.
** "Standing on the shoulders of giants"
*** This is VERY important.

****     Take in everyting. And throw away most of it. This is a multiple-pass, life-long process.)

* There are no Superheroes! Forget about them.
